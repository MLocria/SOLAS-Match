== Description

The Rosetta Foundation Translation eXchange is a web application. It
is designed to be accessed by two groups: NGOs seeking to have content
translated, and volunteer transators who may complete such tasks.
Accessed through the browser, the application displays a list of
translation tasks previously uploaded to the system. A task may have
one resource file attached to it which can be downloaded, translated,
and re-uploaded.

Development began February 2011.

== Technical Documenation

The Translation eXchange is written in PHP 5.2+ code and makes use of
a MySQL 5+ database.

System Requirements

  HTTP server (Apache, for example) with PHP 5.2+ interpreter
  MySQL database
  
Several additional libraries also need to be installed alongside 
Translation eXchange. See installation instructions.

== Installation

1. Extract all files and folders provided to the web server,
with ./public_html/ being the root web folder accessed by the browser.

2. Install Smarty 2.X templating library from <http://www.smarty.net/>, 
noting in which folder you install the library files according to its
installation instructions. The default location is 
"/usr/local/lib/php/Smarty/".

3. Download the 960 Grid System to a folder on your system (used for CSS layouts). Copy the 960.css file to ./public_html/assets/css/.
