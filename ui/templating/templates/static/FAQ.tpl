            <h3 id="vol1">How do I download the original file?</h3>
            <p>The original file can be downloaded from the upload page. At the bottom of this page you will find 3 different options: download the original project file, the original task file or the latest uploaded file.</p>

            <h3 id="vol2">Who do I contact with queries? Who’s the PM?</h3>
            <p>If you have any queries, please contact info@trommons.org. The aim of Trommons is to reduce intervention levels. Therefore, there are no PMs assigned to projects. Any queries can be submitted to the email previously mentioned.</p>

            <h3 id="vol3">What if I need more time?</h3>
            <p>If you find that you need more time on a task, please contact info@trommons.org. They will be able to tell you whether the deadline is strict or not.</p>

            <h3 id="vol4">How do I unclaim a task?</h3>
            <p>To unclaim a task, please consult the relevant task page. At the bottom of the page you will see a box for user feedback. In this box you should give your reason for unclaiming the task and then click the 'Revoke Task & Submit Feedback’ button.</p>

            <h3 id="vol5">I am having trouble downloading the file. What do I do?</h3>
            <p>If you experience problems when downloading a file, please contact info@trommons.org.</p>

            <h3 id="vol6">Why does my language not appear on Trommons?</h3>
            <p>If your language is not listed as a source or target language on the Trommons homepage, this means that there are currently no available tasks that match your language combination(s).</p>

            <h3 id="vol7">There are no tasks for my language pair(s).</h3>
            <p>You can set notification emails if there are no tasks available for your set language pair(s). This can be done via your profile. There are 2 types of notification emails offered:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>All</strong> - this email will list all of the tasks available on Trommons;</li>
                <li><strong>Strict</strong> - this email will only list tasks that match your set languages.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Additionally, you can choose whether you want notification emails on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.</p>

        <h3 id="org1">How do I create an organisation?</h3>
        <p>To create an organisation, go to your profile. In the top right-hand corner of the screen you will see a ‘Create Organisation’ button. When you click on this button you will be brought to a page where you can enter all of the organisation’s details.</p>
        
        <h3 id="org2">How do I download my translation?</h3>
        <p>To download your translation start by finding the relevant project on your dashboard. Click on the project and hit the ‘Complete’ button next to the proofreading task. This will bring you to a page which has a button at the top saying ‘Download Output file’. Click on this and you will have downloaded the finalised text.</p>
        
        <h3 id="org3">How do I know its been finished?</h3>
        <p>All projects have a status. When the status is at 100% the project is complete. Additionally, when you create a project you automatically track the project. This means that you will receive notification emails every time the status of your project changes.</p>
        
        <h3 id="org4">How do I add more members to my organisation?</h3>
        <p>Firstly, anyone who wishes to become a member of an organisation must be a registered user on Trommons. You can add members to your organisation via the ‘Add User’ button on the profile page. Additionally, users can request membership to the organisation which you can accept or refuse.</p>
        
        <h3 id="org5">How do I give feedback?</h3>
        <p>You can find a box for feedback at the bottom of the download page. There are 4 categories for feedback ranked from 1 to 5: corrections, grammar, spelling and consistency. There is also a box where any additional comments can be added.</p>
