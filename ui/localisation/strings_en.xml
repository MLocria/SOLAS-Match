	<string name="faq_29">There is a task review button under each claimed task.</string>
	<string name="faq_30">By clicking on this button, volunteers can view any feedback given on their claimed tasks.</string>
	<string name="faq_31">How do I request a reference email?</string>

	<string name="faq_33">How do I create an avatar on my profile page?</string>
	<string name="faq_34">You can create your own avatar on Trommons via <a href="www.gravatar.com">www.gravatar.com</a>.</string>
	<string name="faq_35">On this site you can upload your own avatar.</string>

	<string name="faq_organisation_questions">Organisation Questions</string>
	<string name="faq_59">How do I view task reviews on my projects?</string>
	<string name="faq_60">Organisations can access task reviews via the project page.</string>
	<string name="faq_61">Feedback can be given by both the translator and proofreader.</string>
	<string name="faq_62">Therefore, organisation members can view feedback from the translator by clicking on the 'Complete' button beside the translation task.</string>
	<string name="faq_63">This will bring you to a page where you can 'View Reviews'.</string>
	<string name="faq_64">The same process can be done for reviews on the proofreading task.</string>
	<string name="faq_65">My project file is quite large. What do I do?</string>	
	<string name="faq_66">If your source file is over a certain word count i.e. 5,000 words, you can segment the project.</string>
	<string name="faq_67">Segmentation is a task that enables you to split your source file into a number of manageable tasks all within the one project.</string>
	<string name="faq_68">To create a segmentation task, go to the create project page. From here, you fill in all of the details as normal.</string>
	<string name="faq_69">At the bottom of the page, instead of clicking on translation and proofreading, please click on segmentation and then create your project.</string>
	<string name="faq_70">This will bring you to the project page where you will see one task- the segmentation task.</string>
	<string name="faq_71">The next step is to click on the segmentation task title.</string>
	<string name="faq_72">You will be brought to a page where you can claim this task (download task button in right hand corner).</string>
	<string name="faq_73">Once, you have claimed the task, you can then upload your segments with their words counts.</string>
	<string name="faq_74">After this, volunteers can claim any of the segments you have uploaded!</string>
    <string name="faq_75">I have finished proofreading the translation. Do I upload a clean file or one with track changes?</string>
    <string name="faq_76">Once you have finished proofreading the translated text, you can upload a clean file on Trommons.</string>
	<string name="faq_77">To make suggestions/comments, please use the ‘provide feedback’ function on the project upload page.</string>
    <string name="faq_terms_list">Solas Match Terminology</string>
    <string name="faq_task">Task:</string>
    <string name="faq_78">A task is a piece of work to be carried out within a project.</string>
    <string name="faq_79">There can be a number of tasks within the one project i.e. segmentation, translation, proofreading, desegmentation.</string>
    <string name="faq_task_stream">Task Stream:</string>
    <string name="faq_80">The task stream is visible on the Trommons home page. Here, you can view a list of the suggested tasks corresponding to your language combinations.</string>
    <string name="faq_81">This will effectively work for you if you have your language combinations set on your profile. You can also filter available tasks by task type, source language and target language.</string>
    <string name="faq_segmentation">Segmentation:</string>
    <string name="faq_82">When a project file has a large word count (i.e. anything over 5,000 words), the file has to be segmented.</string>
    <string name="faq_83">Segmentation appears on the project page the same way as translation and proofreading tasks.</string>
    <string name="faq_84">You claim the task, download the file and split it up into more manageable units for translation and proofreading.</string>
    <string name="faq_85">Once this is done, the segments are uploaded and ready to be translated. Once all segments have been translated and proofread, the files are merged back together in a process called desegmentation.</string>
    <string name="faq_86">The final output is one merged file to be downloaded by the organisation.</string>
    <string name="faq_Tags">Tags:</string>
    <string name="faq_87">Key words that help describe the contents of a project.</string>
    <string name="faq_badges">Badges:</string>
    <string name="faq_88">Badges are assigned to volunteers based on their activity on Trommons.</string>
    <string name="faq_89">Additionally, organisations can create and assign badges to volunteers, so that only these volunteers can work on their projects.</string>
    <string name="faq_project_impact">Project Impact:</string>

    <string name="faq_answer_work_be_credited_1">We ask all partner organisations to credit the volunteer’s work. If you would like your first and last name to be used, please set these on your profile and tick the RECEIVE CREDIT box.</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_work_be_credited_2">If your first and last name is not set, the organisation will have to use your display name. This is also the case for the reference letter, which can be requested via your profile.</string>
